\f0\fs24 \cf0 THE LAST LECTURE\
\
I really liked the last lecture because it was very informative and inspiring to someone who knows what they want and aren\'92t too sure. The man did a good job describing success and where we learn from. What affected me the most is that  everything in this life is affected by you and only you. The ending of the speech really stuck with me how if you just in general a good person, and want to be successful then good karma will come and help from others will as well. Just work harder and it will lead you in the right way.}
